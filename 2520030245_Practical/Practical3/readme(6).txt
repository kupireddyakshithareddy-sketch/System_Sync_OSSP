The given C program demonstrates the creation of a parent and child process using the fork() system call. Before calling fork(), the program displays the PID and PPID of the original process. After fork() is executed successfully, two processes are created: a parent process and a child process. The child process receives a new PID, while its PPID is the PID of the parent process. The return value of fork() is used to identify whether the program is executing in the parent or child process.

The parent and child processes display their respective PID, PPID, and child PID where applicable. The program also displays the message State = Running during its execution. However, the actual process state is maintained by the Linux kernel and was observed separately using Linux monitoring tools. This allows the process information displayed by the program to be compared with the actual state reported by the operating system.

The ps command was used to observe the PID, PPID and current state of the processes. The command ps -o pid,ppid,state,cmd -C practical3 can be used to display this information in a simple format. The top command was used to monitor the processes dynamically and observe their state while they were executing. The /proc/<PID>/status file was also examined to obtain detailed information about an individual process, including its PID, PPID and current state.

The Linux process states were observed through these monitoring tools. A process in the R state is runnable or currently running, while a process in the S state is sleeping or waiting for an event. When a process completes its execution, it is removed from the active process list. A terminated child can also temporarily appear in the Z state, called a zombie state, if its parent has not yet collected its exit status. Since the given program executes very quickly, some states may not remain visible for a sufficient amount of time to be observed directly using ps or top.

From the experiment, it was observed that fork() creates a separate child process with its own PID and establishes a parent-child relationship through the PPID. The ps, top, and /proc tools provide information about the processes as managed by the Linux kernel. The experiment therefore demonstrates process creation, PID and PPID relationships, and the observation of process states during execution.
